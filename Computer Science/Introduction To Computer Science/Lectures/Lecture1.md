# What is Computation?
- Computers perform calculations and remembers the results
- Calculations are built-in to the language and we use them to define our calculations
- Computers only know what you tell them
- Declarative knowledge: Statements of fact
- Imperative knowledge: How to do something
- Fixed program computers: Calculators (Only knows how to do one thing)
- Stored program computers: Machines could store and execute instructions of various kinds
- Basic Machine Architecture
    - Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU): Performs arithmetic and logical operations (Very Basic Operations)
    - Memory: Stores data and instructions
    - Control Unit: Fetches instructions from memory and executes them
    - Input/Output: Communicates with the outside world
- Instructions go line by line
- Interpreter: Executes each instruction in order
- The six primitatives are move left, move right, read, write, erase, and do nothing
- These primitives are the building blocks of all computers and programming languages make use of them
- Anything computable in one language is computable in any other language
- Primitive constructs are words in English and are keywords in programming languages
- Syntax is the structure of a language basically the grammar of a language
- Semantics is the meaning of a language and in English can have multiple meanings but in programming languages it is very specific. Each line has a specific meaning
- Static semantic errors can cause unexpected behavior
- Programs can give unexpected results, won't stop running, or crash (Examples of errors)
- A program is a sequence of definitions and commands
- Commands instruct the interpreter to do something
- A program manipulate data objects
- Objects have a type that defines the kind of things programs can do to them
- Objects are scalars (cannot be subdivided) or non-scalar (have internal structure that can be accessed)
- Scalar objects include int (integers), float (floating point numbers), bool (boolean values), and NoneType (no value)
- You can see the type of an object by using the type function `type(3)`
- Type casting allows you to convert an object from one type to another `int(3.14)` or `float(3)`.
- `print()` is a function that prints the value of an object to the screen
- Expressions combine objects with operators to form new objects like `3 + 4`.
- The operators include `+` (Addition), `-` (Subtraction), `*` (Multiplication), `/` (Division), `**` (Exponent), `%` (Modulus)
- PEMDAS is the order of operations
- Assignment is where you store a value in computer memory using a variable name `x = 3`. It binds the name to the value.
- It lets us reuse names instead of values so it gives the values meaning.
- Equal does not the same thing as assignment. In programming, `radius = radius + 1` is fine because it is adding one to radius but in math it makes no sense because it can never be equal.
- Variables can be rebinded to different values using assignment values but then the old value is lost. `x = 3` then `x = x + 1` will give you 4.
